Note the usage of the `layout-ncol` which arranges the images on the page side by date. Adding the `group` attribute to the markdown images places the images in a gallery grouped together based upon the group name provided.\n\n::: {layout=\"[[1, 1], [1]]\"}\n![Aquinnah](images/mv-1.jpg){group=\"elsewhere\" description=\"The waves break off the coast of Aquinnah on a beautiful summer day.\"}\n\n![Oak Bluffs](images/mv-3.jpg){group=\"elsewhere\" description=\"Oak Bluffs is famous for its Gingerbread cottages, busy town center, and party like atmosphere.\"}\n\n![Vineyard lighthouse](images/mv-2.jpg){group=\"elsewhere\" description=\"The Edgartown Lighthouse is a short walk from downtown and has beautiful views over the entrance to Edgartown Harbor.\"}\n:::\n\n## With computation code chunks\n\nOptions for lightbox can be passed using chunk options.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Simple demo R plot \n#| lightbox:\n#|   group: r-graph\n#|   description: This is 1 to 10 plot\nplot(1:10, rnorm(10))\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Plot about cars data\n#| lightbox:\n#|   group: r-graph\n#|   description: We see our cars data above\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nIt is possible to create several plots, and group them in a lightbox gallery.
