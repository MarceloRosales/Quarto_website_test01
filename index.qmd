## Intent

**docx file**:

/Users/marcelorosales/Box Sync/Niigata Uni Box/Books-Notes/Notes/Research_map and guide.docx

Problem 1: Notebook keeping. Word: Pros: - Best way to manage "tables" - Inter-compatibility with word, excel, ppt. - Easy to send and collaborate with others. Cons: - File size gets too big very fast. - images and links slows down computer. - Files are scatter all around different folders, hard to manage. Most convenient if all notes in only one document. (hint use symlinks?)

Problem 2: Software and code management. Software: - brew to install all research software.

**key Shortcuts**: Files: Excel best tricks.xlsx; Markdown02.docx

Solutions:

### Notekeeping:

**1. Save all notes in one place.**

/Users/marcelorosales/Box Sync/Niigata Uni Box/Books-Notes/Notes

**2. Files and folders:**

/Users/marcelorosales/Box Sync/Github

-   DotFiles: What are dotfiles? To create executable file to install all programs ex. [brew.sh](/Users/marcelorosales/Box%20Sync/Github/DotFiles/CMSs%20dotfiles/CMdotfiles-master/brew.sh) and settings at once with one executable command.
    -   conda shells
    -   iTerm: Fonts
-   GitBooks: What are Gitbooks?
-   mkdocs
-   NiigataU-Carving: html
-   Quarto (VS and R)
-   Rstudio: Shared files among devices
-   Visual Studio Code

/Users/marcelorosales/Box Sync/Documents/R Course01-R Programming A-Z Course02- R Programing - Advanced Analitics R Bookdown R Example scripts R exmple df R external sources R package files R Preferences and packages Rmarkdown Tests forlder Working Directory R Graph Notes.docx R Notes.docx Store-Restore-Rpackages.R Update R and Rstudio.R

1.  Write all in word as markdown??. (better to copy paste form word to rstudio but saves as Rmd, which is a problem for Mkdocs).
2.  Convert to a GitHub page to be accessible from anywhere. To do this I tried\* Hugosites Rbookdown (with good results) use with Rstudio and R. Mkdocs (Very versatile and best look. Trouble. Works only with .md files and not with Rmd, so flow is word -\> Rmd -\> md -\> Mkdocs (loss of function) Quarto (Similar to Mkdocs. In process of learning. )
